          <h2>Introduction to Me!<h2>
          <p>My name is Cole Dennis and I am a student at the University of Missouri. I am majoring in IT and I love computers. During the pandemic that started in 2020, I helped people in Kansas City build computers that needed them for work and school since everything was done online. Building computers and helping people was something that I enjoyed so much that I knew a career in IT was perfect for me. I plan to continue my education at the University of Missouri and find an Internship that suits me!</p>

            <h4>Soccer</h4>
            <p>I played club soccer in Kansas City all throughout elementary, middle, and high school. I played varsity soccer for Staley. My position was a <b>#9</b> forward and a <b>#7</b> winger/attacker. Soccer is my favorite and most passionate sport. If I am not playing, I am watching my favorite teams play on Saturday's or during the week when Champions League games are on. In Europe, FC Barcelona and Chelsea Football Club are my favorite teams to watch. Soccer is not like any other sport with the passion and effort that is put into it which is why I respect the game so much.</p>
